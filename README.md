# Steganografy App

## Overview

The Steganography App is a Flutter application designed to embed text information into images without any visible changes. This is achieved using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique, where the message is encoded into the last bit of each RGB color of every pixel in the image.

Current supported image formats: png, jpg, jpeg

## Using the App

**For Windows and Android:** The easiest way to download the application is from the build folder.

**For iOS, MacOS and Linux:** You will need to build the application from source. To do this, clone the repository, activate the build for your specific system, and compile the executable file.
